This repository contains code for optimizing traffic light durations on BaÄŸdat Street according to real-time vehicle density. By processing video feeds from CCTV cameras with the YOLOv7 algorithm for real-time object detection, relative vehicle density is calculated and traffic scenarios are simulated using Unity. This approach enhances traffic flow and reduces congestion, demonstrating the effective application of real-time image processing and simulation technologies in urban traffic control.
